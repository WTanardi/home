Home?

## 2

What is home?
Where is home?

## 3

Is Home where I grew up?
Is Home where my parents are?
Is Home where my family lives?

<!-- Quick -->
Is Home where I feel familiar?
Is Home where I feel safe?
Is Home where I feel comfortable?
Is Home where I feel welcome?
Is Home where I feel love?

What does home truly mean?

## 5

Well, to me, Home is where
<!-- House or something symbolizing home -->
- I can truly be myself
- I can express my true feelings
- I'm not judged for my wrongs
- I'm not judged for my past
- I'm not judged by my status
- I can grow
- I feel comfortable
- I feel love
- I feel welcome

And Today,
I'm dedicating my birthday to tell you about the home I found
here

In this place once unknown to me
this place with
<!-- Road background -->
- chaotic traffic
- overwhelming crowds
- unbearable heat
- raging thunderstorms
- unfamiliar faces

## 7

I found them
well actually
they found me
<!-- transition from I found them to they found me -->

## 8

It all started with a casual invitation
<!-- display ig dm chat thing -->

## 9

thinking "ah well I've got nothing better to do anyways, why not see what's up, it's a great opportunity for me to explore a part of surabaya too anyway"
so I accepted the invitation

## 10

and when I arrived there
I opened the door
stuck my head in
and heard
BILLYYY ! ! !

## 11

They didn't know me
I didn't know them
But they welcomed me like a long lost brother

And the rest?
Well the rest you can see for yourself

Have you found your home?
No?
You're always welcome here

Welcome Home

Surabaya is to me now what Canaan was to the Israelites
Will this be forever? Who knows
All I know is that I will go wherever The Holy Spirit leads me to
